# MetroMitra
No Maiden's Mini Project i.e. QR-AR Based Indoor Navigation System

PS: To implement a smart indoor navigation system for Metro commuters to provide an efficient wayfinding and optimal route to various access points

Mumbai Metro can be confusing for newcomers and tourists, especially when switching lines or finding exits.  

- **QR Codes:** Scan station-specific QR codes to trigger assistance.
- **AR Navigation:** Get augmented reality overlays that guide you through station interiors.
- **Interactive Metro Map:** Visualize lines, interchanges, and station layouts.
- **Optimal Route Planning:** View the best entry–exit points for your route and destination.
- **Tourist Assistance:** Discover local attractions near each metro station.

Ignore the Metro Mitra folder if it shows on your git. The two main folders are the Indoor-Navigation-System (pura frontend) and backend (yes name says what it does(firebase mai hai)). Both mai open your terminal (split terminal), navigate to backend/INS and type npm install -> npm run dev. Error aaega toh ask GPT to debug and it will make u install wtv.
